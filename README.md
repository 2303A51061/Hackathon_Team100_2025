🌾 AI-Powered Farm Disease Diagnosis System
```text


This project is an AI-based diagnostic system that helps farmers identify crop and livestock diseases based on symptoms and alerts veterinarians when necessary. It improves disease management, promotes early treatment, and enhances farm productivity.

 🚀 Features

- Diagnose common crop diseases (e.g., Leaf Spot, Aphid Attack, Nutrient Deficiency,Pest Infestation)
- Identify frequent livestock issues (e.g.,Respiratory Disease,Mange,Hoof Problems,Conjunctivitis)
- Auto-generates treatment suggestions
- Triggers vet alerts for critical conditions
- Simulated image input (via file names)
- Human-friendly, clean Python code

 🧠 How It Works

1. The farmer inputs:
   - Name
   - Location
   - Type (Crop or Livestock)
   - Visible Symptoms
   - Image path (simulated)

2. The AI Engine:
   - Analyzes symptoms
   - Matches them to known diseases
   - Returns diagnosis and suggested treatment

3. If the disease is serious, it:
   - Notifies the veterinarian
   - Logs an emergency alert
